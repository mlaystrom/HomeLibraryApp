# **The HomeLibrary App**

The HomeLibrary project is a Full-Stack WebMVC application.  It is a personal book database that provides the user with the ability to catalog their book collection, view book details, mark the date finished and enter a book wishlist.  This is a useful web application for any book lover.  I know I could benefit from using something like this that is easy to use and provides a basic service without all the bells and whistles.

This was created as my capstone project while a student with [Eleven Fifty Academy](https://www.elevenfifty.org/).
